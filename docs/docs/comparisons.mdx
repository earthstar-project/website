# Comparisons with other distributed systems

Earthstar makes some different trade-offs than other distributed systems do, mainly in terms of its private data model, and peer discoverability.

## Table of Contents

## Secure Scuttlebutt

- Is a semi-public social network, whereas Earthstar is a private application database.
- Does not allow editing or deletion, whereas Earthstar does.
- Cannot reuse the same identity between many devices, whereas Earthstar can.
- Uses an append only log, whereas Earthstar uses a key-value database.

## Hypercore

- Uses an append-only log, whereas Earthstar uses key-value database.
- Does not natively support multiple users writing to the same hypercore, whereas Earthstar natively supports many users writing data to the same share.
- Connects peers via a distributed hash table, whereas Earthstar peers are undiscoverable by default.
- Does not work in the browser, whereas Earthstar does.

## Syncthing

- Is for synchronising files between devices, whereas Earthstar is an application database which can also synchronise arbitrary data (e.g. photos, video, music).

## IPFS

- Is a global network of content-addressed data, whereas Earthstar is a database for private applications.
- Does not allow explicit deletions of data, whereas Earthstar can explicitly delete data.

## BitTorrent

- Is for transferring files between peers, whereas Earthstar is an application database which can also synchronise arbitrary data (e.g. photos, video, music).
- Divides the work of transferring data between many peers, whereas Earthstar uses a more rudimentary direct transfer.
- Connects peers via a distributed hash table, whereas Earthstar peers are undiscoverable by default.
