# Like a bicycle

We're creating a decentralised, distributed technology a time when a lot of people are talking about 'web3' and it's worth talking about the ways  we are **not that**.

In this talk from [FOSDEM 2022](https://fosdem.org/2022/), Sam Gwilym talks about how we want to build **tools which confer agency** against a backdrop of over-engineered solutions looking for a problem. It's ~20 minutes and gives a good idea of why Earthstar is the way it is, and how it works — kind of like a bicycle.
